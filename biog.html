  <p>Rich James is a writer, musician, performer and producer from the West Midlands in the UK.</p>
  <p>Being born in 1974, he grew up surrounded by music played by his   older brother and sister which captivated him from an early age. Growing   up listening to John Lennon, The Beatles, John Denver, Duran Duran,   Depeche Mode and Shakin&rsquo; Stevens he quickly developed a diverse musical   taste.</p>
  <p>He formed his first band, Havamal+, at Junior School when he was 8   years old.  This progressed into Havamal and later Spellweaver when he   was 15. These bands regularly performed at school concerts. Bands NCA,   Magic Happens and Sona followed through his late teens and early   twenties where Rich was the lead singer and main lyricist.</p>
  <p>In   2001, Rich suffered a breakdown and battled for the next nine years   with mental health problems which lead to him being registered disabled.   However, with support from friends and family, and a great team of   medical professionals, Rich was able to dust himself off and continue   with life in a reasonably &lsquo;normal&rsquo; fashion.</p>
  <p>Rich spent a great deal of time in the late 1990&rsquo;s and early 2000&rsquo;s   experimenting with writing electronic dance style music at home and   recorded a couple of CD&rsquo;s for friends and family. This lead to the   release of his first proper album available for download worldwide,   again in the electronic dance music genre, called &lsquo;Sex Angels&rsquo; in mid   2010 and the accompanying &lsquo;Life Sentence EP&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>In September 2010, Rich started his own independent record label &lsquo;Pink Dolphin Music&rsquo;, for his future releases.</p>
  <p>The debut single &lsquo;I Swoon&rsquo; was released worldwide on 10th January 2011. All profit from the sale of this single will be donated to the charity   Diabetes UK. Rich has been a diabetic since early 2003 and wanted to   help others with the illness.</p>
  <p>To follow up this single, Rich has released a 4-track EP of remixes <em>(&lsquo;Before The Dawn EP – The Remixes&rsquo;) </em>which is <strong>free</strong> to anyone who joins the mailing list.</p>
  <p>April will see the release of his second album, &lsquo;After The Dawn&rsquo;, both as a download and on CD.</p>
  <p>He is married and lives with his wife and four cats.</p>

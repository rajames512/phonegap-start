<h1>The <em>MIGHTY</em><strong> Rich James</strong> App!</h1>
      <P><a href="index.html"><img src="buttons/1330450496_back.png" width="48" height="48" alt="Back"></a>
  <p>Rich James is a songwriter, musician and producer from the West Midlands in the UK. <br>
    <br>
Born in 1974, Rich grew up surrounded by music played by his older   brother and sister which captivated him from an early age. Growing up   listening to John Lennon, The Beatles, John Denver, Duran Duran, Depeche   Mode and Shakin&rsquo; Stevens he quickly developed a diverse musical taste. <br>
<br>
He formed his first band, Havamal+, at Junior School when he was 8 years   old.  This progressed into Havamal and later Spellweaver when he was   15. These bands regularly performed at school concerts. Bands NCA, Magic   Happens and Sona followed through his late teens and early twenties   where Rich was the lead singer and main lyricist. <br>
<br>
In 2001, Rich suffered a breakdown and battled for the next nine years   with mental health problems which lead to him being registered disabled.   However, with support from friends and family, and a great team of   medical professionals, Rich was able to dust himself off and continue   with life in a reasonably &lsquo;normal&rsquo; fashion. <br>
<br>
Rich spent a great deal of time in the late 1990&rsquo;s and early 2000&rsquo;s   experimenting with writing electronic dance style music at home and   recorded a couple of CD&rsquo;s for friends and family. This lead to the   release of his first proper album available for download worldwide,   again in the electronic dance music genre, called &lsquo;Sex Angels&rsquo; in mid   2010 and the accompanying &lsquo;Life Sentence EP&rsquo;. &lsquo;After The Dawn&rsquo; followed   in early 2011. <br>
<br>
In February and March of 2011, the UK television network which covers   Channel 5, 5USA and 5* used Rich&rsquo;s track &lsquo;Infectious Sunshine&rsquo; to back a   trailer for comedy programs on their channel 5*. In February 2012 the   Channel 4/E4 drama &lsquo;Skins&rsquo; featured a remix of Rich&rsquo;s track &lsquo;Hypno-ties&rsquo;   in episode 6 of the latest series. <br>
<br>
Listening to many off-beat rock acts such as Richard Thompson, Nick Cave   and Billy Bragg, Rich approaches Deep Tech House, Techno and Hip-Hop   from a different angle. This results in the unique, slightly skewed from   the norm sounds of the music of Rich James. </p>
